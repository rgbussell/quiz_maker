AI-based Quiz Maker Using Vision and local LLMs

# Set up the API calls to an LLM
The first test will be to use api calls to a non-local llm
We need an api key to make the calls

# setup/install
Install code and dependencies by running install/setup.sh

# API KEY
Your api key needs to be referenced in the .env file
This file is not pushed to repo for security concerns but
the .env.template file will show you the correct format
