# Installer script for the Homework Quiz Generator app on Ubuntu Linux
# This script sets up a virtual environment, installs required dependencies,
# installs necessary libraries within the venv, and creates the app.py file using xAI's Grok API.
# Note: Tesseract OCR is a system-level dependency and cannot be installed directly within a Python virtual environment.
# It must be installed system-wide (via apt), while the Python wrapper (pytesseract) is installed in the venv.
# The venv will use the system-installed Tesseract binary.

# Exit on error
